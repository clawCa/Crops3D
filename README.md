## Overview

Crops3D is a 3D crop dataset designed to support research in agricultural computer vision. It is derived from real-world agricultural scenarios and aims to facilitate advanced 3D point cloud analysis tasks. The dataset is characterized by its diversity, authenticity, and complexity, providing a resource for researchers and practitioners working in the agricultural domain.

## Key Features

- **Diversity**: Crops3D includes data from various point cloud acquisition methods and encompasses eight distinct crop types with a total of 1,230 samples.
- **Authenticity**: The dataset authentically represents crops in real-world agricultural settings, providing a realistic basis for research and development.
- **Complexity**: The intricate structures of the crops in Crops3D exhibit higher complexity compared to existing 3D public datasets, featuring substantial self-occlusion and increased complexity as crops mature.

## Supported Tasks

Crops3D is designed to support three critical tasks in 3D crop phenotyping:

1. **Instance Segmentation of Individual Plants**: Precise segmentation of individual plants in agricultural settings.
2. **Plant Type Perception**: Accurate identification and classification of different crop types.
3. **Plant Organ Segmentation**: Detailed segmentation of plant organs, enabling fine-grained analysis.
